# Rust Markdown Compiler

A lightweight and efficient Markdown to HTML compiler written in Rust. This compiler transforms Markdown syntax into clean, semantic HTML.

## Features

### Headers
Supports three levels of headers using the `#` syntax:

- `#` for the highest level (h1)
- `##` for the second level (h2)
- `###` for the third level (h3)

### Bold and Italic Text

Supports bold and italic text using the `**` and `*` syntax:

- `**text**` for bold text
- `*text*` for italic text

### Paragraphs

Automatically wraps text in `<p>` tags when no other tags are present.

## Usage

```bash
cargo run <input_file.md>
```

The compiler will generate an `output.html` file in the same directory as the input file.

## Example

See the `test.md` file for an example of the compiler in action.
